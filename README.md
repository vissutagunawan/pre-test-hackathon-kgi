## 📌 Rules and Guidelines
### ⚙️ Working in Azure Machine Learning
1. **Setup:**
   - Confirm that you have access to an Azure Machine Learning workspace.
   - Clone this repository to your local machine or directly into the Azure workspace using the following command:
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/GitHub-Nawatech-Lab/[repo-name].git
     ```
     Replace [repo-name] with the repository name.

2. **Environment:**
   - Create a Python environment and install all necessary packages.
   - Maintain a `requirements.txt` file inside each `Case_[case_number]` folder.

3. **Notebooks:**
   - Open or create Jupyter notebooks within Azure Machine Learning Studio.
   - Keep notebooks organized and well-documented with markdown cells to explain your code and results.
   - Develop your models within these notebooks, ensuring clarity and coherence in your explanations.

4. **Execution:**
   - Run the notebooks in sequence to maintain the correct flow of data processing and model training.
   - Validate results, and carefully document any issues or anomalies that arise.

### 🤖 Model Creation
1. **Feature Engineering:** 
   - Perform essential data preprocessing steps, including normalization, feature selection, and handling missing values.

2. **Model Selection:** 
   - Experiment with various machine learning and deep learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.

3. **Training:** 
   - Split your data into training and testing sets.
   - Train your models using suitable techniques and hyperparameters.

4. **Evaluation:** 
   - Evaluate model performance using suitable metrics like MAE, RMSE, and others
   - Document and compare the results across different models to identify the best performer.

### 🚀 Submitting to GitHub
1. **Updates:**
   - Regularly update your repository with the latest changes.

2. **Commits:**
   - Make meaningful commits with clear messages that describe the changes made.

3. **Push:**
   - Push your changes to GitHub using the command:

   ```sh
   git push origin main
   ```
